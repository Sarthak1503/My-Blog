  <h2> How To Manage Your Time- 9 Easy Steps<h2>
  <img src="http://i.imgur.com/YiArYYd.jpg?1">
  <h3>1. Make a List of the Tasks you need to Accomplish</h3>
  <img src="http://i.imgur.com/QOb2SwX.jpg?">
    <p>But before you can manage your time, you need to know what it is you must manage. A list of tasks, from the mundane to the critical, will help you get a handle on what needs to get done. 
 Assign realistic priorities to each task:
          a.) Priority 1: due today by 6pm
          b.)Priority 2: due tomorrow by 6pm
          c.) Priority 3: due by the end of the week
          d.) Priority 4: due during next week</p>

    <h3>2. Balance your Effort</h3>
    <img src="http://i.imgur.com/EULN7sr.jpg?1">
    <p>Work on small portions every day of work that will be due by the end of the week, starting with the most important tasks first.
a.)Do today's tasks. Concentrate On what is at hand, do not allow yourself to lose focus. Then move on to the next daily task. Once today's tasks are completed, mark them as such, and proceed to tomorrow's tasks.
 b.) When tomorrow's tasks are complete, work on the other tasks due by the end of the week, and when those are complete, work on the tasks due early next week. A small portion of each is better than one huge,laborious task and will keep your time managed more efficiently and reduce stress and eliminate burn-out.
c.) Make one of your final daily tasks the completion of tomorrow's task list. Each day should be ended with a new task sheet for tomorrow to keep you on track.

  <h3>7. Reassess the List</h3>
   <img src="http://i.imgur.com/jckqriR.jpg?1">
  <p>a.)Rewrite and prioritize your list on a regular basis.
b.) Add new tasks to the list. This should be done on a daily basis, especially when you are just getting started with a time management regimen.
c.)Eliminate or adjust tasks that are completed, or fall in priority.
d.)Delegate tasks to others. Contrary to popular belief, you don't need to do it all. You can be much more effective if you can delegate tasks as necessary.
e.)Use technology to complete tasks more quickly, efficiently or accurately. Today's mobile technology features dozens, if not hundreds of apps that will help you manage—and even accomplish—your tasks efficiently.
